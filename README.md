# Test App for RPSRT

This app was started to test different methods in meteor to try to achieve real time functionality for my rock paper scissors application. Multiple ways to get data to the view were experimented with and then once an optimal technique was found a database was created to see if this could be connected to the view. Once this was done, means of having two users access the same view from different computers (or different tabs in local host) and then interact with it was experimented with. Once a way to have real time updates of both views was achieved then the images from the main app were loaded in and a mock up of the game was done to see if proof of concept was viable (i.e. having database url paths load into the dom). Once this was done, then means to interact with the dom were wired up to see if this would affect both views in real time. Then, hooking these interactions to the logic of the game was tested. Finally, once all the basics were achieved, then going for the complete data set was tested (wins/losses/ties, having only active users be injected into the view, persisting the w/l/t into the database, making a new game button, and finally adding in protective features (making elements not clickable once selected once). The test was successful and the final step is implementing these techniques into the main application.
